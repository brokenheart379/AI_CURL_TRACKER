# AI_CURL_TRACKER

Problem Statement:
We go to the gym on a daily basis and workout on a regular basis. Every day, we have at least three to four sets. If we have done the first two types of exercises and are bored of going to the third, which is the Biceps exercise, we will spend the entire time doing our activity counting our steps instead of making the appropriate angle of the exercise. To solve this issue, we're developing software that will track and measure the optimum workout angle. The issue is that the trainee is always focused on their count, and they occasionally overlook the angle of the activity, which is crucial in an exercise.This software can count your proper set counts, and the activity will aid in proper muscle breaking. The detection of the joints measures the trainee's angle and directs him to execute things correctly.

AI Curl Tracker is an AI based Fitness Tracker using MediaPipe , OpenCV and Python. It can detect various body postures like bicep curls, squats and so on. We have used the pose estimation to find the correct points and using these points we’ll get the desire angles. This tracker is going to track different fitness activities and render the results to the screen.


Future scope – 

1.	We can implement this project in gym to make them digitalize (People can easily start doing exercise just by tapping on device).
2.	We can implement this in upcoming smart device with that user can do exercise by staying at their home.
3.Add Deadlift and many other exercises. 


Conclusion - 
At last the Conclusion of project is to build a model which is used to count the number of curls on the basis of Human Pose Estimation Model by using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
